I've analyzed the application and its core components. The project is a Superellipse & Glow Generator, and I've prepared a comprehensive documentation with improvement prompts for each module you requested.

The import from Lovable to Replit is successfully completed, and I've updated the progress tracker accordingly.

🛠 Improvement & Development Documentation
Below are the tailored prompts and technical recommendations for each section of the app:

1. Shape (ShapeTab.tsx)
Current State: Handles width, height, and superellipse exponent (curvature).
Improvement Prompt: "Enhance the Shape module by adding support for non-uniform corner radii (asymmetrical squircies). Implement a 'Visual Path Preview' in the sidebar that shows the SVG path points in real-time as the exponent changes."
Refinement: Add a "Lock Aspect Ratio" feature that persists even after presets are loaded.
2. Color (ColorTab.tsx)
Current State: Supports solid colors and complex gradients (Linear, Radial, Conic) using hex values.
Improvement Prompt: "Upgrade the Color module to support the OKLCH color space natively for better perceptual uniformity. Add a 'Smart Contrast' toggle that automatically suggests accessible text colors based on the selected background/gradient."
Refinement: Implement a "Color History" strip for the custom hex picker.
3. Glow (GlowTab.tsx)
Current State: Uses a 4-layer progressive blur system with OKLCH-based color controls.
Improvement Prompt: "Optimize the Glow effect by adding a 'Layer Density' control (2 to 8 layers). Implement 'Glow Blend Modes' (Screen, Addition, Overlay) to allow the glow to interact differently with the background."
Refinement: Add a toggle for "Animated Glow" using CSS keyframes for pulse effects.
4. Effects (EffectsTab.tsx)
Current State: Includes Gaussian blur, Backdrop blur (Glassmorphism), Stroke/Border, and Noise texture.
Improvement Prompt: "Expand the Effects tab with a 'Frost' texture filter and a 'Chromatic Aberration' slider. Improve the Noise overlay by allowing users to choose between 'Grain' and 'Perlin' noise patterns."
Refinement: Add a "Stroke Gradient" option to match the shape's fill.
5. Presets (PresetsTab.tsx)
Current State: LocalStorage-based saving, JSON import/export, and duplication.
Improvement Prompt: "Refactor the Presets module to include 'Cloud Sync' (optional) and a 'Visual Thumbnail' for each saved preset using a mini-canvas preview. Add a 'Default Library' of professional design tokens (e.g., Apple, Material Design, Fluent)."
Refinement: Implement a "Soft Reset" button to return to the initial state without deleting saved presets.
6. CSS (CssTab.tsx)
Current State: Generates detailed CSS/SCSS with custom properties and HTML structure.
Improvement Prompt: "Update the CSS Generator to support Tailwind CSS class generation and React/JSX component export. Add a 'Mini-Minifier' toggle to compress the exported code for production use."
Refinement: Include @supports rules for backdrop-blur to handle browser compatibility.
7. Export (ExportTab.tsx)
Current State: SVG, PNG, CSS, and JSON export options.
Improvement Prompt: "Enhance the Export module with a 'High-Res' toggle for PNG exports (up to 4x scale). Implement a 'Copy SVG Path' button for direct use in design tools like Figma or Adobe XD."
Refinement: Add a "Copy React Component" button that wraps the superellipse in a reusable functional component.
